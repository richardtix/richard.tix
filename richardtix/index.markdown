## Back story

I've always had a knack for words. Ever since I waded into the tech business, my line of job always involved getting things explained to people.
From customer service to Technical Writing, the path was laid out in front of me - I wanted to make laymen understand tech talk. Not an easy thing considering the talk shifts and expands and bubbles day-to-day.
It's my job to keep up and keep you informed.

Juggling words is quite useless without understanding the tech behind it all. From fintech to automotive through startup culture - I've had quite a lot on my plate. Learning is the key to
quality writing and learning is what I do each day in this line of work.
